I think that it's OK that you're late. It's perfectly fine that multiple people's time was wasted because you prioritized an unplanned meeting, leaving us unable to move forward. 

I believe it is necessary to delay the launch of the new feature because we don't have an icon for the new button in place.

I use assumption-based programming because an extra assumption is lost among the many in the given requirements.

I give comfort to middle managers who really don't know what's going on.

I code 55% faster thanks to AI, which makes me valuable.

I will always tell you I do TDD, even if I don't.

I deliver on my promises, or so I say.

I feel loved; we are like a family.
